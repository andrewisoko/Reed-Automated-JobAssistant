</div>

## Intro

A smart job search bot that helps in finding the perfect role on reed.co.uk. Users would simply need to add their preferences, and it quickly suggests the best job matches customised to specific criteria, making the job hunt faster, easier, and more effective.

## Instructions 

* It is required to have a reed.co.uk account with at least a job application sent.

* Python is required to run the program https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download


* Run these commands on command prompt / bash (find it in the PC/laptop search bar)

* Remember to press **ENTER** at the end of each input.

* To check if python has been succesully installed
  
 ```
python --version
```

* To install the bot in the machine 

```
pip install reedautomated
```
* To start the bot

```
run-reedautoassistant
```

the initial freeze of the  command-line interface is part of the process. Wait around 30 minutes if wanting to check job related messages popping up.

* Insert data needed for the website interaction. PERSONAL INFORMATION WILL NOT BE STORED.
* After inserting the data, no active interventions should be needed. Just relax and wait the job suggestions.

  ## Additional notes

  * As long as the terminal (command prompt) screen is not closed, the program should be running even in sleep mode.
  * Even though the bot is independent it is always advised to double check the terminal.
